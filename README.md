# Project Overview
This repository contains scripts for automating email handling and sales report generation tasks. The scripts are designed to streamline processes related to sending emails, organizing email lists into batches, and creating structured sales reports in PDF format.

# Key Features
- **Email Handling:**
  - `send_email`: Function to send emails using SMTP with support for SSL.
  - `send_emails_in_batches`: Function to send emails in batches.
  - `split_emails_into_batches`: Splits a list of emails into manageable batches.
  - `split_emails_into_spreadsheets`: Divides emails into spreadsheets.

- **Sales Reports Automation:**
  - Generates sales reports in PDF format using ReportLab.
  - Provides a template for creating tables and styles within the reports.

# Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the scripts as needed.

# Usage Examples
- **Sending Emails:**
  ```python
  from emails-cleaning.mail import send_email

  send_email(sender_email, receiver_email, subject, body)
  ```

- **Splitting Emails into Batches:**
  ```python
  from emails-cleaning.main import split_emails_into_batches

  split_emails_into_batches(input_file, output_prefix, batch_size)
  ```

  ```

# Architecture Overview
The repository consists of three main scripts:
- `mail.py`: Contains functions for sending emails.
- `main.py`: Handles the organization of emails into batches.
- `sales-reports-automation/main.py`: Manages the generation of sales reports.

The email scripts utilize `smtplib` for email handling, while the sales report script leverages ReportLab for PDF report generation.
